The Universal Declaration of Human Rights (UDHR) is a milestone
document in the history of human rights. Drafted by representatives
with different legal and cultural backgrounds from all regions of the
world, the Declaration was proclaimed by the United Nations General
Assembly in Paris on 10 December 1948 General Assembly resolution 217
A (III) as a common standard of achievements for all peoples and all
nations. It sets out, for the first time, fundamental human rights to
be universally protected.
