1,"In the United States, the beaver is one of the largest members of the rodent family. This animal can manipulate the environment to suit its own needs and can even construct its own home. Beavers are vulnerable to predators when they are on dry land, so they need deep water for safety.","In optics and lens design, the Abbe number, also known as the V-number or constringence of a transparent material, is a measure of the material's dispersion (variation of refractiveindex versus wavelength), with high values of V indicating low dispersion.

A beaver dam can be very large and can contain thousands of pieces of wood cut by the beaver.

Years ago, beavers were prized for their fur and so many were trapped that they almost became extinct. ","The types of physical measurements required under the Rockwood definition are similar to those required under the Trasatti definition, but they are used in a different way, e.g. in Rockwood's approach they are used to calculate the equilibrium vapor pressure of the electron gas. The numerical value for the absolute potential of the standard hydrogen electrode one would calculate under the Rockwood definition is sometimes fortuitously close to the value one would obtain under the Trasatti definition. This near-agreement in the numerical value depends on the choice of ambient temperature and standard states, and is the result of the near-cancellation of certain terms in the expressions.",2,"This answer is correct because the ""harder"" passage has some combination of: longer sentences, less familiar terms, more complicated grammar and generally requires a greater level of education to appreciate its point.",TRUE
4,"Absolute zero is the lower limit of the thermodynamic temperature scale, a state at which the enthalpy and entropy of a cooled ideal gas reaches its minimum value, taken as 0. The theoretical temperature is determined by extrapolating the ideal gas law; by international agreement, absolute zero is taken as ?273.15 degrees on the Celsius scale, which equates to ?459.67 degrees on the Fahrenheit scale. The corresponding Kelvin and Rankine temperature scales set their zero points at absolute zero by definition.","Hunters found the beavers by looking for their dams and lodges, so some beavers stopped building and began living in riverbank holes. Even though beavers are now protected, some beavers still live in these holes, but most build lodges.  Even beavers that build lodges keep a few riverbank holes and escape tunnels to use in case of an emergency.

5,"Another interesting feature of beavers is that they will store a bunch of branches under the water near their lodge to use as food during the winter. When their lake or stream is covered with ice, the beaver has a handy supply of food sealed under the ice.  A colony of beavers, which usually consists of five or more, can stay warm in their lodge with their food supply nearby. ","The laws of thermodynamics dictate that absolute zero cannot be reached using only thermodynamic means, as the temperature of the substance being cooled approaches the temperature of the cooling agent asymptotically. A system at absolute zero still possesses quantum mechanical zero-point energy, the energy of its ground state at absolute zero.

When spring comes and the ice thaws, beavers will feast on water lily tubers, clover and the new green shoots and bark of saplings, or small trees.

As people grow, the bones in their bodies are very much alive.","One model that estimates the properties of an electron gas at absolute zero in metals is the Fermi gas. The electrons, being Fermions, have to be in different quantum states, which leads the electrons to get very high typical velocities, even at absolute zero.

","Other explanations for the accelerating universe include quintessence, a proposed form of dark energy with a non-constant state equation, whose density decreases with time. Dark fluidis an alternative explanation for accelerating expansion which attempts to unite dark matter and dark energy into a single framework.

10,"“Air mass” normally indicates relative air mass, the path length relative to that at the zenith at sea level so, by definition, the sea-level air mass at the zenith is 1. Air mass increases as the angle between the source and the zenith increases, reaching a value of approximately 38 at the horizon. Air mass can be less than one at an elevation greater than sea level; however, most closed-form expressions for air mass do not include the effects of elevation, so adjustment must usually be accomplished by other means.","A broken bone is called a fracture, which can be very painful.

Likewise, animal species such as songbirds and frogs use sound and hearing as a key element of mating rituals or marking territories.","If it is a complex fracture, the doctor might have to operate to put the pieces back together before putting on a cast. If it is a simple fracture, many times the doctor can use the cast to keep the bones in the right place so they can heal.
